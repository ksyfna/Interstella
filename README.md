# Space Navigation: Ignite Computational Thinking & STEM

## The Challenge:
Traditional education often struggles to captivate students and showcase the practical power of computational thinking and STEM. Space navigation, with its inherent complexity and real-world relevance, presents an exciting, untapped opportunity. However, effective integration requires accessible and engaging educational resources.

## Our Solution:
We're developing interactive modules and simulations centered around space pathfinding. These tools will simplify complex concepts, making them understandable and engaging for diverse learners. By navigating virtual space, students will grasp:

## Computantional Thinking
Through algorithms, strategic decision-making, and optimization challenges.
Integrated STEM: By applying principles of physics, mathematics, and computer science in a tangible context.

# Critical Problem-Solving:
By tackling realistic space mission scenarios with dynamic obstacles and limited resources.
